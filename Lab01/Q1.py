"""Python code can be executed by (a) creating a python file and running it from an editor, for example PyCharm or (
b) using the python interactive interpreter. Although, real applications are generally built using an editor, 
it is important to know how to use the interpreter. The latter can be used to quickly test a snippet of code, 
check the presence of a module, etc. Read ‘Learning Python’ book (pages 43-62) in order to learn how to use the 
python interpreter. It is important that you try all the examples in the book."""
