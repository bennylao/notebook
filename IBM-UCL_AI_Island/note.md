# IBM-UCL AI Islands Theme: Local AI Index for NLP on WatsonX

Create an offline NLP AI index system that can be used off-line and 
enable selection of different AI models, for testing, 
benchmarking and passing through to systems integration points. 
APIs are needed to be designed with enterprise design patterns in mind for MLOps. 
Provision this as an extension for WatsonX under the IBM-UCL AI-Islands name. 

## Tech Review

- InstructLab
    - use of LAB method to find tune and improve the performance of LLMs with an even smaller set of human-generated data
    - https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/ai/what-is-instructlab
- RAG
    - cost-efficient method for supplementing an LLM with domain-specific knowledge that wasnâ€™t part of its pretraining. RAG makes it possible for a chatbot to accurately answer questions related to a specific field or business without retraining the model. Knowledge documents are stored in a vector database, then retrieved in chunks and sent to the model as part of user queries

## Random Note
- problem statement
- Map: who why how
- end user, persona, customer journey, 

- watsonx is super expensive
- offline model that can run locally (model with much lower requirements) 

- presentations
- road map, figma, proejct goal, conceptual design, plan, ...

- small model extract the important info from the doc and then offload it into watsonx

## To-do

- Auto fetching LLM models
- .NET MAUI
- Integration between Python and .NET

## meeting notes

- we have to use c# to code the logic behind the app, we have to design the classes and models, like what we did in the python module
- MVVM (model, view, view model)
- .NET support ML thorough ML.net, but it seems like it cannot integrate library like hugging face. we may want to run a local server with fastAPI and we call the api only when we need it
