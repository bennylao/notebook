# IBM-UCL AI Islands Theme: Local AI Index for NLP on WatsonX

Create an offline NLP AI index system that can be used off-line and 
enable selection of different AI models, for testing, 
benchmarking and passing through to systems integration points. 
APIs are needed to be designed with enterprise design patterns in mind for MLOps. 
Provision this as an extension for WatsonX under the IBM-UCL AI-Islands name. 

## Tech Review

- InstructLab
    - use of LAB method to find tune and improve the performance of LLMs with an even smaller set of human-generated data

- RAG
    - cost-efficient method for supplementing an LLM with domain-specific knowledge that wasnâ€™t part of its pretraining. RAG makes it possible for a chatbot to accurately answer questions related to a specific field or business without retraining the model. Knowledge documents are stored in a vector database, then retrieved in chunks and sent to the model as part of user queries
