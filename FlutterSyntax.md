# Flutter Syntax

## StatelessWidget & StatefulWidget
- A stateless widget never changes. Icon, IconButton, and Text are examples of stateless widgets. 
Stateless widgets subclass StatelessWidget.

- A stateful widget is dynamic: for example, it can change its appearance in response to events triggered by 
user interactions or when it receives data. Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, Form, and TextField are examples of 
stateful widgets. Stateful widgets subclass StatefulWidget.
